% Objective
\section*{Objective}
Computer Engineering student graduating in December 2024 experienced in Linux systems both as a server and desktop, programming in C/C++ and Rust for 
Linux systems, Web Assembly for online web applications, Yocto Project for constructing reproduceable custom embedded
Linux images seeking full-time position where I can apply my
technical skills and continuously expand my knowledge base by embracing and mastering new and rising technologies.

% Work Experience
\vspace{-.5cm} \section*{Work Experience} \textbf{ZF Group, Research and Development Intern} \hfill August 2024 - Present\\ 
$\cdot$ Design and Implement a device with capabilities to test different vehicle components to determine if specifications are met\\
$\cdot$ Test device will reduce the amount of time testers spend setting up tests and allow engineers to more easily
  see how test fail\\
$\cdot$ Using Yocto Project to build a custom embedded linux image for an ARM Cortex A7 architecture \\
$\cdot$ Designed a fully Web Assembly application for testers to interact with (using the yew framework in Rust) \\
$\cdot$ Designed a Rust backend application to handle HTTP request and communicate to an onboard microcontroller (ARM Cortex M4)
through IPCC/OpenAMP\\


\vspace{-.25cm}\noindent\textbf{Resideo, Embedded Linux
Engineer Intern} \hfill May 2022 - August 2022\\ 
$\cdot$ Successfully integrated
debuginfod, a file server, into CI/CD pipeline in order to make the debugging
workflow and analyzing core files of embedded Linux systems simpler and more
efficient.\\
$\cdot$ Worked primarily on an CLI and wrote shell scripts to automate
tasks.\\
$\cdot$ Also learned about the Yocto Project as an embedded Linux build
system.\\
$\cdot$ Wrote technical documentation and gave a presentation on 
how tools worked.\\
$\cdot$ Worked in an Agile environment \\

\vspace{-.5cm} \noindent \textbf{eMatrix Energy Systems, Assembly Technician}
\hfill May 2021- August 2021\\ - Constructed and tested various components of
battery packs and battery cells\\ - Worked with engineers on prototyping (constructing, testing)\\
$\cdot$ Followed safetey protocols to ensure a safe working environment
\vspace{-.5cm} \section*{Projects} \textbf{Dynamic Conveyor Belt Positioning
System} \hfill April 2023\\ Designed and implemented a system utilizing an STM32
microcontroller to move an object on a conveyor belt from start to end position
using peripherals such as LED indicator, IR emitter and receiver module,
H-Bridge motor driver module, and motor encoder module, with specific operations
and frequency/duty cycle adjustments based on input signals. \noindent\\
\textbf{Custom 10-bit CPU} \hfill January 2023 - April 2023\\ Designed a custom
10-bit ISA and simulated a CPU using Verilog HDL. CPU was implemented in both
single-cycle and in pipelined fashion with two-level memory hierarchy with cache
and RAM. Branch predictor was also implemented and programs were ran such as
multiply, string copy, and bubble sort.\\
